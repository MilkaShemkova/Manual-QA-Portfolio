üçî Manual Testing for a Food Delivery App ("Foody App")

This repository serves as a key part of my manual testing (Manual QA) portfolio. It demonstrates my ability to analyze requirements, design, and document test scenarios for a real-world application feature.

The Excel file contains the detailed test documentation for this project, focusing on a critical module of the Foody App.

Project Summary & Scope:

* Application Under Test (AUT): A hypothetical "Foody App" (Food Delivery Service).
* Module Tested: The End-to-End Order Placement and Checkout Process.
* Testing Goal: To ensure the core functionality of the Order Placement process is stable, reliable, and handles both valid and invalid data correctly.
* Testing Type: Functional Testing (Positive & Negative Scenarios), Validation Testing, and Usability Checks.
* Test Environment: Web Browser (Chrome) on Desktop and Mobile Viewports.

Test Case Coverage Overview:

The **`Test-Foody-App.xlsx`** file contains **25** detailed test cases, which are categorized as follows:

Positive Scenarios (Happy Path) - 8 .Successful user sign-up, browsing the menu, adding items to the cart, and completing payment. |
Negative Scenarios - 10. Attempts to order with an expired card, entering an invalid delivery address, attempting to apply a non-existent promo code, and checking out with an empty cart. 
Validation Testing- 7. Verifying required field checks, boundary conditions for quantity limits, and correct error messages displayed for incorrect email/phone formats. 

‚úÖ Skills Demonstrated

1. Ability to transform requirements/user stories into clear, actionable test steps.
2.Maintaining a professional standard for test artifacts (using Test IDs, Pre-conditions, Steps, Expected Results).
3.Identifying edge cases and creating effective negative test scenarios to ensure system robustness.
